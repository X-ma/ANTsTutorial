# Introduction

\newthought{Advanced Normalization Tools}[^ants] is software for biomedical image analysis with a focus on registration, segmentation, geometric quantification and statistics. 
Statistical methods are available in *ANTsR* ^[http://stnava.github.io/ANTsR/] which tightly integrates *ANTs* with the *R* statistical computing language.  This document briefly highlights major features of *ANTs*.

# Provenance and Testing

Much core functionality in *ANTs* lives in ITK, a project to which we contribute regularly.  This core is tested on many platforms via `ctest` and the results are on the ITK dashboard^[https://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=Insight].
*ANTs* is also tested with every commit via codeship ^[https://codeship.com] and Travis ^[https://travis-ci.org/stnava/ANTs].  Many (not all) *ANTs* programs support `programName --version`.  Our github commit hashes give the best way to track code versions by identifying core and dependency versions.  See the *ANTs* website for current testing results and **installation** instructions.

# In conjunction with other analysis systems

ANTs and ITK work synergistically within a well-defined I/O and world
coordinate system.  Using FSL, SPM or other pre-processing in 
conjunction with ITK and ANTs must be done with extreme care. The 
physical spaces (or interpretation of image headers) may not be the same in different systems.  Such inconsistencies may lead to severe misinterpretation of results. \marginnote{WARNING!}

# Data types

## Images
Images are the core data type in ANTs. Valid extensions are determined by ITK ^[www.itk.org] image input/output libraries ^[NiftiImageIO, NrrdImageIO, GiplImageIO, HDF5ImageIO, JPEGImageIO, GDCMImageIO, BMPImageIO, LSMImageIO, PNGImageIO, TIFFImageIO, VTKImageIO, StimulateImageIO, BIORadImageIO,
MetaImageIO, MRCImageIO, GE4ImageIO, GE5ImageIO, MGHImageIO].  ITK images can be of arbitrary dimensionality and pixel type, but in *ANTs* we instantiate `float` pixel type in 2, 3 or 4 dimensions.


## CSV files and point sets

CSV (comma separated value) files are useful for storing tabular data.  We may also use them to store point sets.  It is critical when using point sets with *ANTs* to ensure that the physical space of the points matches that of the images.  It is best to start with our standard example of registering images and applying the results to points ^[https://github.com/stnava/chicken].  Point sets may also be stored in the binary format provided by the Meta I/O library ^[http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK/MetaIO/Documentation].  This format allows much faster I/O for large datasets.


# Registration

The most well-known components of *ANTs* relate to mapping between coordinate systems ^[Registration: targeting of points in one coordinate system onto another].  Briefly, these maps may relate to:

* statistical image similarity: image difference, correlation or mutual information

* translation, rotation, affine, B-spline or various diffeomorphic models ^[Diffeomorphism: differentiable map with differentiable inverse]

* spatial or spatiotemporal maps

* dense or sparse transformation models, the latter being similar to SIFT or HOGG

* applying composite transformations to images, labels or point sets.

These components all exist within an integrated framework which is nearly always capable of incorporating many features or applying to multiple different modalities.^[http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fninf.2014.00044/abstract]

## Evaluation history

ANTs became well known because it performed well in a variety of open competitions related to image registration.  Most of these successes occurred in the days before the community had many such competitions. ^[Klein 2009, Murphy 2011, SATA 201*, BRATS 2013, etc.]  Highlights include:  

* finishing in the top rank in the Klein 2009 evaluation on brain MRI

* finishing in the top rank in the Murphy 2011 lung CT evaluation

* top SATA 2012 and 2013 finishers used ANTs

* performing well in a cardiac motion estimation competition

* well-known robust performance on large datasets 

Although ANTs has often performed well without using domain knowledge, it is still valuable to use problem-specific solutions when feasible.

## Quick start

ANTsR gives some quick registration options.  One can achieve similar performance with `antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh`.

```{r reg, fig.cap='quick parameter free registration'}
fi <- antsImageRead(getANTsRData("r16") )
mi <- antsImageRead(getANTsRData("r64") )
mytx <- antsRegistration(fixed=fi, moving=mi, typeofTransform = c('SyN') )
mywarpedimage <- antsApplyTransforms( fixed=fi, moving=mi,
  transformlist=mytx$fwdtransforms )
plot(fi, mi %>% iMath("Canny",1,5,12) )
plot(fi, mywarpedimage %>% iMath("Canny",1,5,12) )
```

## Low-dimensional

translation, rigid, affine

## High-dimensional

transformations with many parameters

## Parameter choices and testing

We wrote a paper that details procedures for evaluating analysis software ^[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3766821/].  We wrote this paper in order to help those who want to use or evaluate *ANTs* make more informed choices on how to proceed.  Briefly: (1) ask developers questions; (2) leverage biologically motivated testing metrics that are independent of registration.

## Equations

You can also include \LaTeX\ equations in the margin by explicitly invoking the `marginfigure` environment.

\begin{marginfigure}
$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$
\caption{An equation}
\end{marginfigure}

Note the use of the `\caption` command to add additional text below the equation.

## Full Width Figures

You can arrange for figures to span across the entire page by using the `fig.fullwidth` chunk option. 

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap = "Full width figure"}
qplot(wt, mpg, data=mtcars, colour=factor(cyl))
```

Note the use of the `fig.width` and `fig.height` chunk options to establish the proportions of the figure. Full width figures look much better if their height is minimized.

## Main Column Figures

Besides margin and full width figures, you can of course also include figures constrained to the main column.

```{r, fig.cap = "Another figure"}
qplot(factor(cyl), mpg, data = mtcars, geom = "boxplot")
```

# Segmentation, geometry and labeling

## Weingarten map-based surface curvature and area

The shape operator provides a beautiful way to compute the mean or Gaussian curvature (or related values) in any three-dimensional image ^[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15344450].  The *ANTs* program that impl

One of the most prominent and distinctive features of this style is the extensive use of sidenotes. There is a wide margin to provide ample room for sidenotes and small figures. Any use of a footnote will automatically be converted to a sidenote. ^[This is a sidenote that was entered using a footnote.] 

If you'd like to place ancillary information in the margin without the sidenote mark (the superscript number), you can use the `\marginnote` command. \marginnote{This is a margin note.  Notice that there isn't a number preceding the note.}

Note also that the two footnote references (`tufte_latex` and `books_be`, both defined below) were also included in the margin on the first page of this document.

# Cortical thickness pipeline

You can use the **xtable** package to format \LaTeX\ tables that integrate well with the rest of the Tufte handout style. Note that it's important to set the `xtable.comment` and `xtable.booktabs` options as shown below to ensure the table is formatted correctly for inclusion in the document.

```{r, results='asis'}
library(xtable)
options(xtable.comment = FALSE)
options(xtable.booktabs = TRUE)
xtable(head(mtcars[,1:6]), caption = "First rows of mtcars")
```

# Brain mapping in the presence of lesions or other obstructions

Our fully automated registration and segmentation approach for the lesioned occluded brain uses machine learning to identify and down-weight missing data.  One may also uses pre-identified inclusive masks to focus registration on healthy tissue ^[` antsRegistration -d 3 ... etcetera ... -x healthyTissueMask.nii.gz` ].

# Overview of ANTs programs

ANTs executables come in either binary ( compiled from `C++` ) or script form ( usually `bash` or `R` ).  Here, we summarize the relevants programs.
