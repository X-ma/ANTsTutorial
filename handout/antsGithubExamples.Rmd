# Introduction

[Advanced Normalization Tools](https://github.com/stnava/ANTs) uses [github](www.github.com) to organize and
distribute simple, reproducible examples.   We also provide a [wiki](https://github.com/stnava/ANTs/wiki) and the indispensable [antsHandout](https://github.com/stnava/ANTsTutorial/raw/master/handout/antsHandout.pdf).  We also perform [tutorials](https://github.com/stnava/ANTsTutorial) when invited to do so.

# ANTsR: reproducible science with bioimaging data

[ANTsR](https://github.com/stnava/ANTsR) illustrates several use cases throughout its [vignettes and documentation](https://github.com/stnava/ANTsR/releases/tag/latest).  Built in the style of *R*, most if not all ANTsR functions are accompanied by reproducible examples.  See, for instance, `?antsRegistration` in ANTsR.   Soon, [*Neuroconductor*](https://neuroconductor.org/) will also be a source of help.

# Links to github examples with brief comments

These are different than wiki examples in that they come with data.

A user interested in these examples should *clone* the repository via *git*.  

```{bash,eval=FALSE}
git clone reponame.git
```

The repository will show you how to do this, otherwise search for the answer from the cloud.
