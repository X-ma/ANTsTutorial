# ANTsTutorial
Guide to tutorial materials for ANTs/R

The goal of this tutorial is to use ANTs and ANTsR to turn raw data
into clean data.

We will focus on brain magnetic resonance images.  

* Organize and inspect the raw data to understand its structure and identify potential problem cases.

* Identify hypotheses and quantification targets.

* Develop a template construction procedure to address our hypotheses.

* Attach prior distributions to the template.

* Process the full data with ANTs pipelines.

* Extend the baseline processing to interpret auxiliary modalities.

* Perform univariate and multivariate statistical tests.

* Explore prediction algorithms based on imaging data.

Along the way, we will cover theoretical foundations as well as practical 
insights arising from our experience with processing biological images 
numbering from the tens to tens of thousands.
