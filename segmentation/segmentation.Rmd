COMMAND:
     N4BiasFieldCorrection
          N4 is a variant of the popular N3 (nonparameteric nonuniform normalization)
          retrospective bias correction algorithm. Based on the assumption that the
          corruption of the low frequency bias field can be modeled as a convolution of
          the intensity histogram by a Gaussian, the basic algorithmic protocol is to
          iterate between deconvolving the intensity histogram by a Gaussian, remapping
          the intensities, and then spatially smoothing this result by a B-spline modeling
          of the bias field itself. The modifications from and improvements obtained over
          the original N3 algorithm are described in the following paper: N. Tustison et
          al., N4ITK: Improved N3 Bias Correction, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,
          29(6):1310-1320, June 2010.

OPTIONS:
     -d, --image-dimensionality 2/3/4
          This option forces the image to be treated as a specified-dimensional image. If
          not specified, N4 tries to infer the dimensionality from the input image.

     -i, --input-image inputImageFilename
          A scalar image is expected as input for bias correction. Since N4 log transforms
          the intensities, negative values or values close to zero should be processed
          prior to correction.

     -x, --mask-image maskImageFilename
          If a mask image is specified, the final bias correction is only performed in the
          mask region. If a weight image is not specified, only intensity values inside
          the masked region are used during the execution of the algorithm. If a weight
          image is specified, only the non-zero weights are used in the execution of the
          algorithm although the mask region defines where bias correction is performed in
          the final output. Otherwise bias correction occurs over the entire image domain.
          See also the option description for the weight image.

     -r, --rescale-intensities 0/(1)
          At each iteration, a new intensity mapping is calculated and applied but there
          is nothing which constrains the new intensity range to be within certain values.
          The result is that the range can "drift" from the original at each iteration.
          This option rescales to the [min,max] range of the original image intensities
          within the user-specified mask.

     -w, --weight-image weightImageFilename
          The weight image allows the user to perform a relative weighting of specific
          voxels during the B-spline fitting. For example, some studies have shown that N3
          performed on white matter segmentations improves performance. If one has a
          spatial probability map of the white matter, one can use this map to weight the
          b-spline fitting towards those voxels which are more probabilistically
          classified as white matter. See also the option description for the mask image.

     -s, --shrink-factor 1/2/3/4/...
          Running N4 on large images can be time consuming. To lessen computation time,
          the input image can be resampled. The shrink factor, specified as a single
          integer, describes this resampling. Shrink factors <= 4 are commonly used.

     -c, --convergence [<numberOfIterations=50x50x50x50>,<convergenceThreshold=0.0>]
          Convergence is determined by calculating the coefficient of variation between
          subsequent iterations. When this value is less than the specified threshold from
          the previous iteration or the maximum number of iterations is exceeded the
          program terminates. Multiple resolutions can be specified by using 'x' between
          the number of iterations at each resolution, e.g. 100x50x50.

     -b, --bspline-fitting [splineDistance,<splineOrder=3>]
                           [initialMeshResolution,<splineOrder=3>]
          These options describe the b-spline fitting parameters. The initial b-spline
          mesh at the coarsest resolution is specified either as the number of elements in
          each dimension, e.g. 2x2x3 for 3-D images, or it can be specified as a single
          scalar parameter which describes the isotropic sizing of the mesh elements. The
          latter option is typically preferred. For each subsequent level, the spline
          distance decreases in half, or equivalently, the number of mesh elements doubles
          Cubic splines (order = 3) are typically used.

     -t, --histogram-sharpening [<FWHM=0.15>,<wienerNoise=0.01>,<numberOfHistogramBins=200>]
          These options describe the histogram sharpening parameters, i.e. the
          deconvolution step parameters described in the original N3 algorithm. The
          default values have been shown to work fairly well.

     -o, --output correctedImage
                  [correctedImage,<biasField>]
          The output consists of the bias corrected version of the input image.
          Optionally, one can also output the estimated bias field.

     --version

$ Atropos --help

COMMAND:
     Atropos
          A finite mixture modeling (FMM) segmentation approach with possibilities for
          specifying prior constraints. These prior constraints include the specification
          of a prior label image, prior probability images (one for each class), and/or an
          MRF prior to enforce spatial smoothing of the labels. Similar algorithms include
          FAST and SPM. Reference: Avants BB, Tustison NJ, Wu J, Cook PA, Gee JC. An open
          source multivariate framework for n-tissue segmentation with evaluation on
          public data. Neuroinformatics. 2011 Dec;9(4):381-400.

OPTIONS:
     -d, --image-dimensionality 2/3/4
          This option forces the image to be treated as a specified-dimensional image. If
          not specified, Atropos tries to infer the dimensionality from the first input
          image.

     -a, --intensity-image [intensityImage,<adaptiveSmoothingWeight>]
          One or more scalar images is specified for segmentation using the
          -a/--intensity-image option. For segmentation scenarios with no prior
          information, the first scalar image encountered on the command line is used to
          order labelings such that the class with the smallest intensity signature is
          class '1' through class 'N' which represents the voxels with the largest
          intensity values. The optional adaptive smoothing weight parameter is applicable
          only when using prior label or probability images. This scalar parameter is to
          be specified between [0,1] which smooths each labeled region separately and
          modulates the intensity measurement at each voxel in each intensity image
          between the original intensity and its smoothed counterpart. The smoothness
          parameters are governed by the -b/--bspline option.

     -b, --bspline [<numberOfLevels=6>,<initialMeshResolution=1x1x...>,<splineOrder=3>]
          If the adaptive smoothing weights are > 0, the intensity images are smoothed in
          calculating the likelihood values. This is to account for subtle intensity
          differences across the same tissue regions.

     -i, --initialization Random[numberOfClasses]
                          Otsu[numberOfTissueClasses]
                          KMeans[numberOfTissueClasses,<clusterCenters(in ascending order and for first intensity image only)>]
                          PriorProbabilityImages[numberOfTissueClasses,fileSeriesFormat(index=1 to numberOfClasses) or vectorImage,priorWeighting,<priorProbabilityThreshold>]
                          PriorLabelImage[numberOfTissueClasses,labelImage,priorWeighting]
          To initialize the FMM parameters, one of the following options must be
          specified. If one does not have prior label or probability images we recommend
          using kmeans as it is typically faster than otsu and can be used with
          multivariate initialization. However, since a Euclidean distance on the inter
          cluster distances is used, one might have to appropriately scale the additional
          input images. Random initialization is meant purely for intellectual curiosity.
          The prior weighting (specified in the range [0,1]) is used to modulate the
          calculation of the posterior probabilities between the likelihood*mrfprior and
          the likelihood*mrfprior*prior. For specifying many prior probability images for
          a multi-label segmentation, we offer a minimize usage option (see -m). With that
          option one can specify a prior probability threshold in which only those pixels
          exceeding that threshold are stored in memory.

     -s, --partial-volume-label-set label1xlabel2xlabel3
          The partial volume estimation option allows one to modelmixtures of classes
          within single voxels. Atropos currently allows the user to model two class
          mixtures per partial volume class. The user specifies a set of class labels per
          partial volume class requested. For example, suppose the user was performing a
          classic 3-tissue segmentation (csf, gm, wm) using kmeans initialization. Suppose
          the user also wanted to model the partial voluming effects between csf/gm and
          gm/wm. The user would specify it using -i kmeans[3] and -s 1x2 -s 2x3. So, for
          this example, there would be 3 tissue classes and 2 partial volume classes.
          Optionally,the user can limit partial volume handling to mrf considerations only
          whereby the output would only be the three tissues.

     --use-partial-volume-likelihoods 1/(0)
                                      true/(false)
          The user can specify whether or not to use the partial volume likelihoods, in
          which case the partial volume class is considered separate from the tissue
          classes. Alternatively, one can use the MRF only to handle partial volume in
          which case, partial volume voxels are not considered as separate classes.

     -p, --posterior-formulation Socrates[<useMixtureModelProportions=1>,<initialAnnealingTemperature=1>,<annealingRate=1>,<minimumTemperature=0.1>]
                                 Plato[<useMixtureModelProportions=1>,<initialAnnealingTemperature=1>,<annealingRate=1>,<minimumTemperature=0.1>]
                                 Aristotle[<useMixtureModelProportions=1>,<initialAnnealingTemperature=1>,<annealingRate=1>,<minimumTemperature=0.1>]
                                 Sigmoid[<useMixtureModelProportions=1>,<initialAnnealingTemperature=1>,<annealingRate=1>,<minimumTemperature=0.1>]]
          Different posterior probability formulations are possible as are different
          update options. To guarantee theoretical convergence properties, a proper
          formulation of the well-known iterated conditional modes (ICM) uses an
          asynchronous update step modulated by a specified annealing temperature. If one
          sets the AnnealingTemperature > 1 in the posterior formulation a traditional
          code set for a proper ICM update will be created. Otherwise, a synchronous
          update step will take place at each iteration. The annealing temperature, T,
          converts the posteriorProbability to posteriorProbability^(1/T) over the course
          of optimization.

     -x, --mask-image maskImageFilename
          The image mask (which is required) defines the region which is to be labeled by
          the Atropos algorithm.

     -c, --convergence [<numberOfIterations=5>,<convergenceThreshold=0.001>]
          Convergence is determined by calculating the mean maximum posterior probability
          over the region of interest at each iteration. When this value decreases or
          increases less than the specified threshold from the previous iteration or the
          maximum number of iterations is exceeded the program terminates.

     -k, --likelihood-model Gaussian
                            HistogramParzenWindows[<sigma=1.0>,<numberOfBins=32>]
                            ManifoldParzenWindows[<pointSetSigma=1.0>,<evaluationKNeighborhood=50>,<CovarianceKNeighborhood=0>,<kernelSigma=0>]
                            JointShapeAndOrientationProbability[<shapeSigma=1.0>,<numberOfShapeBins=64>, <orientationSigma=1.0>, <numberOfOrientationBins=32>]
                            LogEuclideanGaussian
          Both parametric and non-parametric options exist in Atropos. The Gaussian
          parametric option is commonly used (e.g. SPM & FAST) where the mean and standard
          deviation for the Gaussian of each class is calculated at each iteration. Other
          groups use non-parametric approaches exemplified by option 2. We recommend using
          options 1 or 2 as they are fairly standard and the default parameters work
          adequately.

     -m, --mrf [<smoothingFactor=0.3>,<radius=1x1x...>]
               [<mrfCoefficientImage>,<radius=1x1x...>]
          Markov random field (MRF) theory provides a general framework for enforcing
          spatially contextual constraints on the segmentation solution. The default
          smoothing factor of 0.3 provides a moderate amount of smoothing. Increasing this
          number causes more smoothing whereas decreasing the number lessens the
          smoothing. The radius parameter specifies the mrf neighborhood. Different update
          schemes are possible but only the asynchronous updating has theoretical
          convergence properties.

     -g, --icm [<useAsynchronousUpdate=1>,<maximumNumberOfICMIterations=1>,<icmCodeImage=''>]
          Asynchronous updating requires the construction of an ICM code image which is a
          label image (with labels in the range {1,..,MaximumICMCode}) constructed such
          that no MRF neighborhood has duplicate ICM code labels. Thus, to update the
          voxel class labels we iterate through the code labels and, for each code label,
          we iterate through the image and update the voxel class label that has the
          corresponding ICM code label. One can print out the ICM code image by specifying
          an ITK-compatible image filename.

     -r, --use-random-seed 0/(1)
          Initialize internal random number generator with a random seed. Otherwise,
          initialize with a constant seed number.

     -o, --output [classifiedImage,<posteriorProbabilityImageFileNameFormat>]
          The output consists of a labeled image where each voxel in the masked region is
          assigned a label from 1, 2, ..., N. Optionally, one can also output the
          posterior probability images specified in the same format as the prior
          probability images, e.g. posterior%02d.nii.gz (C-style file name formatting).

     -u, --minimize-memory-usage (0)/1
          By default, memory usage is not minimized, however, if this is needed, the
          various probability and distance images are calculated on the fly instead of
          being stored in memory at each iteration. Also, if prior probability images are
          used, only the non-negligible pixel values are stored in memory.
          <VALUES>: 0

     -w, --winsorize-outliers BoxPlot[<lowerPercentile=0.25>,<upperPercentile=0.75>,<whiskerLength=1.5>]
                              GrubbsRosner[<significanceLevel=0.05>,<winsorizingLevel=0.10>]
          To remove the effects of outliers in calculating the weighted mean and weighted
          covariance, the user can opt to remove the outliers through the options
          specified below.

     -e, --use-euclidean-distance (0)/1
          Given prior label or probability images, the labels are propagated throughout
          the masked region so that every voxel in the mask is labeled. Propagation is
          done by using a signed distance transform of the label. Alternatively,
          propagation of the labels with the fast marching filter respects the distance
          along the shape of the mask (e.g. the sinuous sulci and gyri of the cortex.
          <VALUES>: 0

     -l, --label-propagation whichLabel[lambda=0.0,<boundaryProbability=1.0>]
          The propagation of each prior label can be controlled by the lambda and boundary
          probability parameters. The latter parameter is the probability (in the range
          [0,1]) of the label on the boundary which increases linearly to a maximum value
          of 1.0 in the interior of the labeled region. The former parameter dictates the
          exponential decay of probability propagation outside the labeled region from the
          boundary probability, i.e. boundaryProbability*exp( -lambda * distance ).

Optional arguments:

     -m:  max. N4 <-> Atropos iterations        Maximum number of (outer loop) iterations between N4 <-> Atropos.
     -n:  max. Atropos iterations               Maximum number of (inner loop) iterations in Atropos.
     -p:  segmentation priors                   Prior probability images initializing the segmentation.
                                                Specified using c-style formatting, e.g. -p labelsPriors%02d.nii.gz.
     -r:  mrf                                   Specifies MRF prior (of the form '[weight,neighborhood]', e.g.
                                                '[0.1,1x1x1]' which is default).
     -b:  posterior formulation                 Posterior formulation and whether or not to use mixture model proportions.
                                                e.g 'Socrates[1]' (default) or 'Aristotle[1]'.  Choose the latter if you
                                                want use the distance priors (see also the -l option for label propagation
                                                control).
     -l:  label propagation                     Incorporate a distance prior one the posterior formulation.  Should be
                                                of the form 'label[lambda,boundaryProbability]' where label is a value
                                                of 1,2,3,... denoting label ID.  The label probability for anything
                                                outside the current label

                                                  = boundaryProbability * exp( -lambda * distanceFromBoundary )

                                                Intuitively, smaller lambda values will increase the spatial capture
                                                range of the distance prior.  To apply to all label values, simply omit
                                                specifying the label, i.e. -l [lambda,boundaryProbability].
     -y:  posterior label for N4 weight mask    Which posterior probability image should be used to define the
                                                N4 weight mask.  Can also specify multiple posteriors in which
                                                case the chosen posteriors are combined.
     -s:  image file suffix                     Any of the standard ITK IO formats e.g. nrrd, nii.gz (default), mhd
     -k:  keep temporary files                  Keep temporary files on disk (default = 0).
     -u:  use random seeding                    Use random number generated from system clock in Atropos (default = 1)
     -w:  Atropos prior segmentation weight     Atropos spatial prior probability weight for the segmentation (default = 0)

     -z:  Test / debug mode                     If > 0, attempts to continue after errors.
